# Localization Strategy

### Client side

1. Compile separate js, html files for each language containing the code and the extracted
   translations for that view

### HTML

1. Set `_text` property in the element with the text content, for example:

    <label _text="Login">Login</label>

2. The `translate` method will read the text from the language dict, if not found, then
will try to split words and find words, if those not found then will pass

3. `translate` will be called when new html is appended / dom is modified.

### JS

1. set labels as `_.t("text")`

2. the t method in `_` will called the translate method.

### Python

1. Use the `_("text")`

2. the `_` method will call the translate module that will load the compiled language

### Building translations

1. A simple regex will extract all the strings that are written in the above formats and will
build a translation file for that particular language in the i18n folder

2. Folders:
   - lib/i18n (all translation files for framework)
   - i18n (all translation files for app)
   - public/en
   - public/hi etc will have all view folders updated with the latest translations

## translate.py

### extract(filename)

Extract messages from a file

### extract_all()

Extract all messages and make / update message file

### _(text)

Return the translated text for current `wn.lang`

### get_view_translations(translations)

Return `$.extend(wn.translations, { [json] })` to be appended in the script section of the view

## translate.js

### t(text)

Return the translated text for current `wn.lang` based on loaded translations
