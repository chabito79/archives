 1.  Grants received are covered under item 4(a).
 2.  Estimated interest accrued and credited to NRI deposits during the year has been treated as notional outflow under invisible payments and added as reinvestment in NRI deposits under banking capital.
 3.  In accordance with the provision of IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (5th Edition), gold purchased from the Government of India by the  RBI has been excluded from the BOP statistics. Data for the earlier years has, therefore, been amended by making suitable adjustments in “Other Capital-Receipts and Foreign Exchange Reserves”. Similarly, item “SDR Allocation” has been deleted from the table.
 4.  With effect from 1996-97, private transfer receipts include redemption in rupees of both principal and interest under Non-Resident External (Rupee) Account [NRE(R)A] and Non-Resident Non-Repatriable Rupee Deposit [NR(NR)RD] schemes. This marks an improvement in data reporting.
 5.  The presentation of balance of payments statistics in the above table differs from the adjusted balance of payments statistics published in the previous issues of the Economic Survey.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         6.
