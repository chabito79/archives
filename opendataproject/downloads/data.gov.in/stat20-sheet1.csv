"Gender Budget Statement was first introduced in Budget 2005-06. In order to make further refinement to the Statement, every year the Ministries/Departments are requested through the Annual Budget Circular to highlight the quantum of public expenditure earmarked in budget for women. On the basis of the information thus furnished by the Ministries/Departments, the Gender Budget Statement is prepared. This Statement indicates, in two parts, the budget provisions for schemes that are substantially meant for the benefit of women. Part A details schemes in which 100% provision is for women, Part B reflects schemes where the allocations for women constitute at least 30% of the provision. ","","","","","","","","","",""
"The rationale of Gender Budgeting arises from the recognition of the fact that the national budget impacts various sections of the society differently, through the pattern of resource allocation and priority accorded to competing sectors. Gender Budgeting in its simplest connotation is 'Gender Analysis' of the budget aimed at examining the budgetary allocation through a gender lens. The purpose of gender budgeting is to monitor expenditure and public service delivery from a gender perspective, as a means of mainstreaming women's concerns in all activities and improving their access to public resources. This statement has received an impetus over the last eight budgets with growing awareness of gender sensitivities. Gender Budgeting is an evolving area where, with better understanding and appreciation of the subject, more and more Ministries/Departments are reviewing programmes and schemes to address the quantum of resources that have the budgetary potential to impact and address the development needs of women.","","","","","","","","","",""
"In BE 2013-14, 30 Ministries/Departments and 5 Union territories Governments have made allocations for gender budget statement. The statement shows 18.6% increase for 100% women specific programmes, having gone up from ` 22,969 crore in BE 2012-13 to ` 27,248 crore in BE 2013-14. Overall, taking parts A and B together, there is an increase of 10.2% from ` 88,143 crore in BE 2012-13 to ` 97,134 crore in BE 2013-14. ","","","","","","","","","",""
