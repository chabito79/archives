"","Planning   Commission  had   issued   guidelines   on  formulation, implementation and monitoring  of SCSP/ TSP from time to time.  Scheduled  Castes Sub Plan  (SCSP)   for  Scheduled   Castes  (SCs)  and  the  Tribal  Sub  Plan  (TSP)  for  the Scheduled  Tribes  (STs)  are  intended  to  channelize the  flow  of  resources   from  the general  sectors  in  the  Central   Ministries/Departments  towards   the  development  of Scheduled  Castes  and Scheduled  Tribes, at least in proportion  to their numbers  in the population,  both in physical  and financial terms. The allocation  under these components is provided  for the purpose  of creating productive assets, human  resource  development of the Scheduled  Castes and Scheduled Tribes through adequate  education  and health services, and to provide  physical  and financial security  against  all types of exploitation and oppression.","","","",""
2.0,"Government  had  taken   the   initiative   to  make   separate   allocations   for  the Scheduled  Castes  Sub  Plan  (SCSP)  and Tribal  Sub  Plan  (TSP)  as part  of the  Plan allocations  from the financial  year 2011-12. These allocations  are also indicated clearly in the Memorandum of Understanding signed  between  the  Planning  Commission  and the Ministry/ Department  concerned.    Government has devised a proper accounting mechanism to account for such allocations by opening dedicated Minor Head “Special Component   for  Scheduled   Castes  (Code  789)”  and  “Tribal  Sub  Plan  (Code  796)”. Instructions  have been  issued  to the Ministries/  Departments in which such allocations are made by the Planning  Commission, as part of the Plan Agreement, in their Budget to ensure that the provisions are accurately reflected  in the Minor  Head  concerned.   The provisions made under these Minor Heads are not allowed to be re-appropriated, except to the same Minor  Heads  in other schemes  under SCSP  and TSP, thereby  preventing any possibility  of diversion.","","","",""
